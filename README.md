# Operator Panel Desk (OpDesk)

A modern, real-time operator panel for Asterisk PBX systems, similar to FOP2 but built with modern technologies.
 
## Features

- **Authentication & User Management**: Login by username or extension with password; JWT-based auth; admin and supervisor roles
- **Role-based Access**: Admins see all extensions and queues; supervisors see only their assigned extensions and queues (filter by role, extension, and queue)
- **Monitor Modes (multi-select)**: Per-user selection of Listen, Whisper, and/or Barge; only allowed actions are shown in the UI
- **Real-time Extension Monitoring**: Live status updates for extensions (filtered by user scope)
- **Active Call Tracking**: See who's talking to whom with duration and talk time tracking
- **Call Duration & Talk Time**: Track total call duration and actual conversation time separately
- **Call Log/CDR History**: View historical call records with filtering and search capabilities
- **Call Recording Playback**: Listen to recorded calls directly from the web interface
- **Queue Management**: Monitor and manage call queues (filtered by user scope for supervisors)
- **Supervisor Features**: Listen, whisper, and barge into calls (according to each user’s allowed monitor modes)
- **CRM Integration**: Send call data to external CRM systems with support for multiple authentication methods (API Key, Basic Auth, Bearer Token, OAuth2)
- **QoS Data**: View Quality of Service metrics for calls
- **Web call (Softphone)**: Make and receive calls from the browser via WebRTC; in-call controls (hold, mute, transfer, keypad); redirect to softphone and browser notifications on incoming call
- **WebSocket-based**: Event-driven architecture for instant updates; state is filtered per user (admin vs supervisor scope)

## Web call (Softphone)

OpDesk includes a **WebRTC softphone** so you can make and receive calls directly in the browser—no desk phone required.

### What you get

- **Make calls**: Open the Softphone tab, enter a number or extension, and click Call. The app uses your extension and secret to register with the PBX over WebRTC (SIP over WebSocket).
- **Receive calls**: Incoming calls show an answer/decline screen. The app switches to the Softphone tab automatically and can show a **browser (system) notification** so you’re alerted even if the tab is in the background. Allow notifications when prompted (or when opening the Softphone tab) for the best experience.
- **In-call**: Once the call is answered, an in-call view shows the other party’s number/name, call duration, and controls: Hold, Mute, New call, Conference, Transfer, Attended Transfer, Record, Keypad, and Video. The red **End call** button hangs up.
- **Sounds**: Ringtone for incoming calls, dial tone for outgoing (while ringing), and a short hangup sound when the call ends.

### Requirements

- **HTTPS**: Browsers allow microphone access only on **HTTPS** or **localhost**. See [HTTPS (for WebRTC Softphone / Microphone)](#https-for-webrtc-softphone--microphone) below for dev and production setup.
- **PBX WebSocket**: Asterisk must expose a **wss://** endpoint for WebRTC. In OpDesk **Settings**, set **WEBRTC_PBX_SERVER** to that URL (e.g. `wss://your-pbx-ip:8089/ws`). Using **ws://** on a TLS port can cause Asterisk “Internal SSL error”; see [Asterisk "Internal SSL error" (WebRTC / wss://)](#asterisk-internal-ssl-error-webrtc--wss) if you see that.
- **Extension and secret**: Each user needs an **extension** and **extension secret** (WebRTC registration). Configure the extension in the Extensions panel and set the secret via the key icon in the Extensions tab or in Settings.

### Using the Softphone

1. Log in and ensure the Softphone is **registered** (green indicator in the header or Softphone tab).
2. **Make a call**: Go to the **Softphone** tab (or click the headset icon in the header), enter the number or extension, and click the green call button.
3. **Incoming call**: The app opens the Softphone tab and shows the incoming screen; if you allowed notifications, a system notification appears. Click **Answer** or **Decline**.
4. **During the call**: Use Hold, Mute, Keypad, etc., and click the red **End call** button to hang up.

## Authentication & User Management

- **Login**: Use extension or username plus password. Tokens are JWT; the frontend stores the token and user info (role, extension, monitor modes, assigned scope).
- **Roles**:
  - **Admin**: Full access; sees all extensions, queues, and calls; can manage users (Settings → Users).
  - **Supervisor**: Sees only extensions and queues assigned to them; can use only the monitor actions (Listen / Whisper / Barge) enabled for their account.
- **User scope**: Admins assign each supervisor a set of **extensions (agents)** and **queues**. The panel and API return only data within that scope.
- **Monitor modes**: Each user can have one or more of **Listen**, **Whisper**, and **Barge**. Only those options appear as actions in the Extensions and Active Calls panels. Configured in Settings → Users (admin only).
- **Default account**: After install, log in with username `admin` and the password set by the installer (e.g. `OpDesk@2026`). Change the password after first login.

## HTTPS (for WebRTC Softphone / Microphone)

Browsers allow microphone access only on **HTTPS** or **localhost**. To use the Softphone from other machines (e.g. over the LAN), serve the app over HTTPS.



## Prerequisites

- Linux system (Debian/Ubuntu, CentOS/RHEL/Fedora, or Arch Linux)
- Issabel or FreePBX system installed
- Asterisk PBX with AMI enabled
- MySQL/MariaDB (for FreePBX extension list)
- sudo access (for installing system packages)
- **curl** (required for downloading nvm during installation)

**Note:** The installation script will automatically install:
- Python 3.11+ and pip
- Node.js 24+ (via nvm)
- git, lsof, and curl (if not already installed)

## Installation

### Automated Installation (Recommended)

Use the provided installation script for a complete automated setup:

**One-liner (download and run):**
```bash
curl -k -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ibrahimgamal99/OpDesk/main/install.sh && chmod +x install.sh && ./install.sh
```

**Or if you already have the repository:**
```bash
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh
```

The script will:
1. Detect your OS and install git, lsof, and curl (if not already installed)
2. Clone the repository to `/opt/OpDesk` (if not already present)
3. Install nvm (Node Version Manager) and Node.js 24
4. Install Python 3.11+ and pip
5. Auto-detect Issabel or FreePBX installation
6. Auto-configure database credentials:
   - **Issabel**: Retrieves MySQL root password from `/etc/issabel.conf`
   - **FreePBX**: Creates database user `OpDesk` with auto-generated password
7. Auto-configure AMI user `OpDesk` with random secret in `/etc/asterisk/manager.conf`
8. Create `backend/.env` file with all settings
9. Install Python dependencies (with `--break-system-packages` on Debian/Ubuntu)
10. Install Node.js dependencies
11. Display installation summary report

**Note:** The script automatically configures:
- Database connection (auto-detects credentials for Issabel/FreePBX)
- AMI user and secret (auto-generated and added to Asterisk config)
- CDR database name (`asteriskcdrdb`)
- Recording root directory (`/var/spool/asterisk/monitor/`)

### Manual Installation

If you prefer manual installation:

#### Backend

1. Install Python dependencies (system-wide, no virtual environment required):

```bash
cd backend
pip3 install --break-system-packages -r requirements.txt
```

**Note:** This project does not use a virtual environment. Dependencies are installed directly to your Python environment. The `--break-system-packages` flag is required for newer pip versions when installing system-wide.

2. Configure environment variables in `backend/.env`:

```env
# Operating System
OS=debian

# PBX System
PBX=FreePBX

# Database Configuration (for extensions list and CDR)
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=3306
DB_USER=asteriskuser
DB_PASSWORD=your_db_password
DB_NAME=asterisk
DB_CDR=asteriskcdrdb

# Asterisk Recording Root Directory
ASTERISK_RECORDING_ROOT_DIR=/var/spool/asterisk/monitor/

# AMI Configuration
AMI_HOST=127.0.0.1
AMI_PORT=5038
AMI_USERNAME=OpDesk
AMI_SECRET=your_ami_secret
```

**Note:** The installation script automatically creates this file with appropriate values for your system.

#### Frontend

1. Install Node.js 24 (if not already installed):

```bash
# Install nvm
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.40.3/install.sh | bash
source ~/.nvm/nvm.sh
nvm install 24
nvm use 24
```

2. Install Node.js dependencies:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

## Running

### Quick Start (Recommended)

After running the installation script (`./install.sh`), start the application:

```bash
./start.sh
```

This will start both backend and frontend services with logging. Press `Ctrl+C` to stop.

**Default login:** Username `admin` with the password configured during installation (e.g. `OpDesk@2026`). Change it after first login.

### Development Mode

#### Option 1: Using the start script (recommended)

```bash
./start.sh
```

#### Option 2: Manual start

Start the backend server:

```bash
cd backend
python server.py
```

The server will run on `http://localhost:8765`

Start the frontend development server (in a separate terminal):

```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

The frontend will run on `http://localhost:5173` with hot reload.

### Production Mode

1. Build the frontend:

```bash
cd frontend
npm run build
```

2. Start the server (serves both API and frontend):

```bash
cd backend
python server.py
```

Access the application at `http://localhost:8765`

## API Endpoints

All API access (except login) requires a valid JWT in the `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header. Responses for extensions, calls, and queues are filtered by the current user’s role and assigned scope (supervisors see only their extensions and queues).

### Auth (no token required)

- `POST /api/auth/login` - Login with `{ "login": "username_or_extension", "password": "..." }`; returns `access_token` and `user` (id, username, role, extension, monitor_modes, allowed_agent_extensions, allowed_queue_names)
- `GET /api/auth/me` - Return current user (requires valid token)

### REST API (token required)

- `GET /api/extensions` - List monitored extensions (filtered by user scope)
- `GET /api/calls` - Active calls (filtered by user scope)
- `GET /api/queues` - Queue information (filtered by user scope)
- `GET /api/status` - Server status
- `GET /api/call-log` - Call log/CDR history (supports `limit`, `date`, `date_from`, `date_to`)
- `GET /api/recordings/{file_path}` - Serve call recording audio files
- `GET /api/settings` - Application settings
- `POST /api/settings` - Update application settings
- **User management (admin only):** `GET/POST /api/settings/users`, `GET/PUT/DELETE /api/settings/users/{id}` - List, create, update, delete users and assign extensions, queues, and monitor modes

Supervisor actions (listen, whisper, barge) are sent via WebSocket messages; the server enforces the user’s allowed monitor modes and scope.

### WebSocket

Connect to `ws://localhost:8765/ws?token=<JWT>` (or send `{ "token": "<JWT>" }` in the first message) for real-time updates.

The WebSocket connection provides:
- **Per-user filtered state**: Each client receives only the extensions, calls, and queues they are allowed to see (admin = full; supervisor = assigned agents and queues only)
- Real-time extension status updates
- Active call events
- Queue status changes
- System notifications
- Client can send actions: `get_state`, `sync`, `listen`, `whisper`, `barge`, `queue_add`, `queue_remove`, `queue_pause`, `queue_unpause`, etc.


## CRM Integration

OpDesk supports integration with external CRM systems to automatically send call data after each call ends.

### Supported Authentication Methods

- **API Key**: Custom header authentication
- **Basic Auth**: Username/password authentication
- **Bearer Token**: Token-based authentication
- **OAuth2**: OAuth2 flow with client credentials

### Configuration

CRM integration can be configured through the web interface (Settings → CRM Settings) or via the database settings table:

- `CRM_ENABLED`: Set to `true` or `1` to enable
- `CRM_SERVER_URL`: Your CRM server URL
- `CRM_AUTH_TYPE`: `api_key`, `basic_auth`, `bearer_token`, or `oauth2`
- Additional fields based on selected authentication type
